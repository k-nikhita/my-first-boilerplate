# my-first-boilerplate
Learning about boilerplates. 

Setup Steps:
- Copied package.json contents from Prue's boilerplate template: https://github.com/pruesinghnagra/boilerplate/blob/main/package.json
*The package.json file is the center of any Node.js project or npm package. It stores information about your project, similar to how the <head> section of an HTML document describes the content of a webpage. It consists of a single JSON object where information is stored in key-value pairs. There are only two required fields; "name" and "version", but itâ€™s good practice to provide additional information about your project that could be useful to future users or maintainers.
